"2;1080;34;;""Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store"," and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"""".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite."";5;1;4;General;Dresses;Dresses",,,,,,,,,,,
3;1077;60;Some major design flaws;I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c;3;0;0;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,

5;847;47;Flattering shirt;This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!;5;1;6;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,
6;1080;49;Not for the very petite;I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.;2;0;4;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,
7;858;39;Cagrcoal shimmer fun;I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.;5;1;1;General Petite;Tops;Knits,,,,,,
8;858;39;Shimmer, surprisingly goes with lots;I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...;4;1;4;General Petite;Tops;Knits,,,,,
9;1077;24;Flattering;I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.;5;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10;1077;34;Such a fun dress!;""I'm 5""""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller)", a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party," or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath."";5;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses",,,,,,,,,
11;1077;53;Dress looks like it's made of cheap material;Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.;3;0;14;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,,,

13;1095;53;Perfect!!!;More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid;5;1;2;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,
"14;767;44;Runs big;""Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).",,,,,,,,,,,,
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.,,,,,,,,,,,
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.,,,,,,,,,,,,

15;1077;50;Pretty party dress with some issues;This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip;3;1;1;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,,,
16;1065;47;Nice, but not for my body;I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!;4;1;3;General;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,
17;1065;34;You need to be at least average height, or taller;Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.;3;1;2;General;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,,,,
18;853;41;Looks great with white pants;Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,
19;1120;32;Super cute and cozy;A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.;5;1;0;General;Jackets;Outerwear,,,,,,,,,
20;1077;47;Stylish and comfortable;I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.;5;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,

22;1080;55;I'm torn!;I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb;4;1;14;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,
"23;1077;31;Not what it looks like;""First of all", this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.,,,,,,,,,,,

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning," but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!"";2;0;7;General;Dresses;Dresses",,,,,,,,,,,
24;1077;34;Like it, but don't love it.;Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.;3;1;0;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,
25;847;55;Versatile;I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!;5;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,
"26;697;31;Falls flat;""Loved the material"," but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"""" and there was atleast 5"""" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans"";3;0;0;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge",,,,,,,,,,,
27;949;33;Huge disappointment;I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh;2;0;0;General;Tops;Sweaters,,,,,,,,,,,,
28;1003;31;Loved, but returned;The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end.;4;1;0;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,,
29;684;53;Great shirt!!!;I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....;5;1;2;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge,,,,,,,,,,,,
30;4;28;Great layering piece;This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Sweaters,,,,,,,,,
31;1060;33;;Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!;5;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,,,,,,,,
32;1060;46;Cuter in oerson!;I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer;5;1;7;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,,,,,,
33;1060;21;Love these pants;These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.;5;1;0;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,,,,,,,,
"34;949;36;Mehh;""I ordered this 3 months ago", and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale," but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back."";2;0;0;General;Tops;Sweaters",,,,,,
35;697;39;Love this dress!;This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!;5;1;0;Initmates;Intimate;Lounge,,,,,,,,,,,
36;1060;65;Lovely!;Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!;4;1;3;General Petite;Bottoms;Pants,,,,,,,,,,,

42;862;40;;This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,

"45;862;48;Beautiful!;""Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""""""" and i generally wear a 6"," the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!"";5;1;9;General;Tops;Knits",,,,,,,,,,,
46;862;43;Love the two tone design;I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.;4;1;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,,
47;862;40;;I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,,
48;823;52;;Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering;5;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,
49;910;56;Love the color!;This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Fine gauge,,,,,,,,,,
50;862;33;Love the embroidery!;Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,
51;862;46;Cute for fall;This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.;4;1;1;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,

54;862;39;Flattering and comfortable;Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun;5;1;34;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,
55;862;66;Cute top;Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.;4;1;2;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,
56;862;61;Soft and cute as can be!;This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.;5;1;2;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,,
57;368;33;;I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!;2;0;3;Initmates;Intimate;Intimates,,,,,,,,
58;862;31;Boring front, great back;This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it.;3;0;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,
"59;1095;36;;""I got this in the petite length", size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn't have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline," it's a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th"";4;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses",,,,,,
60;368;52;Soft and comfortable;I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.);4;1;1;Initmates;Intimate;Intimates,,,,,,,,,,
61;1095;41;Gorgeous dress!;This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.;5;1;0;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,,
62;368;36;Itchy tags;3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!;1;0;0;Initmates;Intimate;Intimates,,,,,,,,,,
63;862;28;Must have;I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.;5;1;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,,

66;862;58;;Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren't doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate;4;1;2;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,
67;862;60;Super cute and unique top;Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me;4;1;9;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,
68;862;40;Beautiful top;Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!;5;1;1;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,
69;862;37;I wanted to love this top...;I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...;2;0;0;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,,,,
70;1078;56;Great summer fabric!;I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.;3;0;1;General Petite;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,
71;845;38;Cute," but massive sweep;""This top is so cute"," but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"""" and sweep is over 70"""". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in"," but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style."";4;1;10;General Petite;Tops;Blouses",,,,,,,,,
72;822;36;Short and boxy;Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s;2;0;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,
"73;850;27;Beautiful design;""I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c", bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. ,,,,,,,,,,

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.,,,,,,,,,,,,

148;1011;47;Cute skirt!;I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight;5;1;1;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,,,,
149;1008;64;Very pretty;This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.;5;1;0;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,
"150;1008;38;A beautiful skirt!;""This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal", but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down," worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too """"out-there"""" (unless you want it to be", of course!). the fit is true to size," and the delicate details are just lovely."";5;1;2;General;Bottoms;Skirts",,,,,,,
151;1008;36;Gorgeous skirt!;Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!;5;1;1;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,,,
152;1008;39;Beautiful;Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i'm usually a 10, but still a little snug.;4;1;0;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,,,
153;829;53;Not impressed...;Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...;3;0;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,
154;829;36;Fair;The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!;3;1;1;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,
155;829;44;Great colors but....;I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.;3;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,
156;829;48;Beautiful colors;This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.;5;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,
157;1008;37;;This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.;5;1;1;General;Bottoms;Skirts,,,,,,,,,,,
158;523;43;Australian sizing!!;So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.;3;0;2;Initmates;Intimate;Swim,,,,,,,,,,,,
159;829;53;;I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !;4;1;7;General Petite;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,
160;829;33;Vibrant metallic;This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .;4;1;0;General Petite;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,
161;1126;39;So sad not mine;Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.;4;1;0;General;Jackets;Outerwear,,,,,,,,,,
162;829;52;Scratchy," uncomfortable top;""The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit", sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.,,

i agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses, but the flattering fit and quality (has a nice built in slip) i found to be what you may expect from the brand. if you go in thinking it's more of a spring/summer dress, you will not be disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,

421;1077;68;Easy and stylish;I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!;5;1;2;General;Dresses;Dresses,,,,,,,,,,,

427;829;33;Disappointed;I got this shirt in the mail today and was really excited to try it on. other reviewers said that it ran large so i ordered a size down and it fit perfect. i looked in the mirror and noticed the ruffles were misaligned and obviously so. i want to exchange it in the store but seeing that the size is not longer available online, i'm not really sure i'll find another one in my size.;4;1;0;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,

444;829;48;Undecided;Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.;4;1;6;General;Tops;Blouses,,,,,,,,,,,,

446;964;27;So much better irl;When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!;5;1;0;General;Jackets;Jackets,,,,,,,,,,

448;872;26;Ultimately unimpressed;I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.;3;0;3;General;Tops;Knits,,,,,,,,
